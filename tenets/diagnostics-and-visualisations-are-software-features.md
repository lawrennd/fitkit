# Tenet: diagnostics-and-visualisations-are-software-features

**Title**: Diagnostics and visualisations are scientific-software features

**Description**: The scientific software should prioritize diagnostics and visualisations that help explain and stress-test results (ranked “barcodes”, scatterplots, and flow-native views), not just produce numbers.

**Rationale**: The intent so far in the notebook is exploratory and comparative: understand structure, sanity-check rankings, and make results communicable.

**Examples**:

- Treat interactive plots as first-class research artifacts, not incidental debug views.
- Provide small, opinionated “standard plots” that travel well between datasets.
